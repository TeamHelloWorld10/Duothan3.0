# Duothan3.0 - Pharmacy Web Application

To help address the shortage of medical resources in Sri Lanka, we were proposed to build an online pharmacy directory that will connect patients with the nearest pharmacies that have the medicines they need. Our solution will feature a search functionality that allows users to search for medicines by name and find the closest pharmacies with the medicines in stock. We will also maintain a directory of all the pharmacies in Sri Lanka, which users can search by medicine, location, name, or other relevant criteria. Most importantly, we will keep track of the availability of essential medicines in each pharmacy and update this information in real-time to ensure that users have access to up-to-date and accurate information. Our goal is to help patients in Sri Lanka receive the care they need by connecting them with the medical resources they require.
